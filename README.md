# Basic-Algorithms


This repo is the collection of Sorting and Serching Algorithm which i have studied in 3rd sem of my DS and Algo. course and these are all implemented using Python3. I have made individual module for each Algorithm and called it through **main.py** file. I will add new algorithms as i learn them and if you want use my code then you are welcome.
