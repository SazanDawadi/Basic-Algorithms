# Basic-Algorithms


This repo is the collection of Sorting and Serching Algorithm which i have studied in 3rd sem of my DS and Algo course and these are all implemented using Python3. I have made individual module for each Algorithm and called it through **main.py** file. I will add new algorithms as i learn them .If you want to use my code then feel free to use it.HAppy coding:)
